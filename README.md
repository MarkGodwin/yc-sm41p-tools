# yc-sm41p-tools

The YC-SM41P is a powerful 4" PoE powered smart control panel from Portworld/Sunworld, which runs a customisable version of Android 11.

The devices are very nice and flexible - a more powerful alternative to the Sonoff NSPanel.

# Software modifications:

* Enable the built-in [Proximity Sensor](./proximity_sensor/README.md)
* Customise the Boot & Shutdown image (coming soon)
* Use my version of [Wallpanel](https://github.com/MarkGodwin/wallpanel-android) with better HA integration and support for Screen brightness, on/off and remote Shutdown.
